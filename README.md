# Update Webroot Util - U.W.U.
## v0.1
### A simple script to update small webapp projects
## How it Works
Have a small webapp you're working on locally, but don't want to store everything in the webserver directory?\
Just drop ```update.py``` into your development directory, supply the path to your webserver's directory, run it in the background, and now every change you make to a file in that directory tree will be copied to the webserver.
## Requirements
none! completely portable
