# Update Webroot Util -- U.W.U. -- (ᵕᴗ ᵕ⁎) v0.5
## A simple script to update small html projects
### info: This script assumes that there are two directories
- A project __DEV__ directory, (where the script lives)
- An outward facing web server __SRV__ dirctory set up
## How it Works
1. put ```uwu.py``` in your __DEV__ directory, where you will be working on the code and making changes
2. run ```./uwu.py -b``` to run U.W.U. in the background
3. start working, the changes will be copied to the __SRV__ directory
## Requirements
None! Completely portable.  
Although not tested in Windows, it might work there.
