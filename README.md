# Update Webroot Util - U.W.U.
## (ᵕᴗ ᵕ⁎) v0.5
### A simple script to update small webapp projects
## How it Works
info: this assumes there are two directories
	- a project (DEV) directory
    - and an outward facing web server (SRV) dirctory set up
	1. put ```uwu.py``` in your DEV directory, where you will be working on the code and making changes
	2. run ```uwu.py``` or ```uwu.py -b``` if you don't have access to another tty
	3. start working, the changes will be copied to the SRV directory
## Requirements
none! completely portable
